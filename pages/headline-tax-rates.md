## Important notes

- Socials are capped in _some_ countries (ex: Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, etc.) based on the min/avg salary (or a multiple thereof). In other countries, only _some_ socials are capped (ex: Montenegro). Yet in other countries, only citizens and PRs are subject to socials, while temporary residents are exempt (ex: Bulgaria) or can contribute voluntarily (ex: Malaysia). In others, socials are not capped (ex: Panama).

- CGT can be flat or progressive based on how many years the asset is held. In some countries, only a portion of the gain (ex: 50%) is taxed. Rates may differ for rental properties (as opposed to shares).

- The standard VAT is shown above. Some products (food, medicine, books) are subject to reduced VAT, others are zero-rated or exempt (insurance, bank fees, education).

- Tax rates may change every few years especially in developing countries. There are other taxes too like royalty tax, property/land tax, inheritance tax, etc.
