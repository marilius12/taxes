# Headline tax rates

These are the standard tax rates for common destinations excluding:

- any special tax regimes (ex: territorial, remittance, non-resident) or incentives (ex: SMB tax rate)
- any municipal or local taxes (ex: Italy), surtaxes (ex: Croatia, Montenegro), etc.
- any allowances, deductions, tax credits, or exempt income on your tax return
- any special cases like participation exemption, non-resident WTH tax, etc.

Note that tax rates may change every few years especially in developing countries. There are other taxes too like property tax, excise tax, inheritance tax, etc.
