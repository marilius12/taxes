# Income norms in Romania

In most countries, you pay income tax on your gross income. In Romania, this is known as the "real system". However, they also have an alternative tax base for self-employed called the **income norm** (norma de venit) defined in art. 69 of the [Fiscal Code](https://static.anaf.ro/static/10/Anaf/legislatie/Cod_fiscal_norme_11022020.htm)

Income norms are fixed income quotas published each year by ANAF (Agenţia Naţionala de Administrare Fiscală), the Romanian revenue service. They are categorized by [county](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Romania) (județ) and business activity. If you qualify, you can be taxed on your income norm instead of your actual income.

To qualify, you need to:

- be self-employed (for example, **PFA** - Persoană Fizică Autorizată)
- engage in one of the listed activities (other than liberal professions in art. 67 para. (2))
- earn less than **EUR 100k** in **gross income** per year

Here's the current list (in Romanian) - [Normele anuale de venit (2022)](https://static.anaf.ro/static/10/Anaf/AsistentaContribuabili_r/Normevenit2022/Norme_venit_2022.html). For example, in Bucharest, for "information technology consultancy activities", CAEN code 6202, the norm is **RON 35,000** (USD ~8.5k):

> 120. Servicii executate in domeniul informaticii, altele decit cele care genereaza drepturi de autor sau drepturi conexe dreptului de autor - 6202: activitati de consultanta in tehnologia informatiei (35000) - 6203: activitati de management (gestiune si exploatare) a mijloacelor de calcul (35000)

What does this mean? It means that regardless of your gross income, as long as it's below EUR 100k, you are only taxed on RON 35k. The higher your income, the lower the tax rate, as your tax base (i.e. income norm) remains the same. Here's a sample calculation:

|                  | Amount                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Gross income     | RON 394,184 = EUR 80,000 \* 4.9273          |
| Income norm      | RON 35,000                                  |
| Base for socials | RON 27,600/y = RON 2,300.00/mo \* 12        |
| Social sec (25%) | RON 6,900 = 25% \* RON 27,600               |
| Health ins (10%) | RON 2,760 = 10% \* RON 27,600               |
| Income tax (10%) | RON 2,534 = 10% \* (35,000 - 6,900 - 2,760) |
| Total tax        | RON 12,194 = 2,534 + 6,900 + 2,760          |
| Effective rate   | **3.09%** = 12,194 / 394,184                |

### Socials

Generally, the socials are _not_ capped for regular employees. However, for self-employed, the annual base for:

- social ins: chosen by tax payer and can't be lower than 12 min gross salaries (art. 148 para. (4))
- health ins: 12 minimum gross salaries (art. 170 para. (4) and [Section 4](https://static.anaf.ro/static/10/Anaf/legislatie/Cod_fiscal_norme_11022020.htm#B148_2))

For 2021, the NMW is 2,300/mo which amounts to the annual base of 27,600.

### Income threshold

If you earn more than EUR 100k in gross income, you'd have to calculate your tax obligation using the real system of 10% PIT (art. 69 para. (9)). In that case, it might make more sense to operate as a [micro-enterprise](./lowest-tax-countries#micro-enterprise-in-romania-).

### Adjustments

Some categories of people can also adjust their income by applying correction coefficients (art. 69 para. (10)).

### Tax filing

Based on art. 69², you need to file form 212 (Declarație unică privind impozitul pe venit și contribuțiile sociale datorate de persoane fizice) to assess your income tax and social contributions. Here's one for [2021](https://static.anaf.ro/static/10/Anaf/formulare/D_212_OPANAF_14_2021.pdf).
