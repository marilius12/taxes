# Income norms in Romania

In most countries, you pay income tax on your net income. In Romania, this is known as the "real system". However, they also have another system for self-employed (Art. 69 of the [Fiscal Code](https://static.anaf.ro/static/10/Anaf/legislatie/Cod_fiscal_norme_11022020.htm)) called the **income norm** (norma de venit).

Income norms are fixed income quotas published each year by ANAF. They are categorized by [county](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Romania) (judeÈ›) and business activity. If you qualify, you can be taxed on your income norm instead of your actual income.

To qualify, you need to:

- be a **sole properietor** (**PFA**, persoanele fizice autorizate)
- engage in one of the listed activities (other than liberal professions in Art. 67 para. (2))
- earn less than **EUR 100k** in **gross income** per year

Here's the current list (in Romanian) - [Normele anuale de venit (2021)](https://static.anaf.ro/static/10/Anaf/AsistentaContribuabili_r/Normevenit2021/Norme_venit_2021.html). For example, in Bucharest, for "information technology consultancy activities", CAEN code 6202, the norm is **RON 35,000** (USD ~8.5k):

> 120. Servicii executate in domeniul informaticii, altele decit cele care genereaza drepturi de autor sau drepturi conexe dreptului de autor<br>6202: activitati de consultanta in tehnologia informatiei - 35000<br>6203: activitati de management (gestiune si exploatare) a mijloacelor de calcul - 35000

What does this mean? It means that regardless of your gross income, as long as it's below EUR 100k, you are only taxed on RON 35k. Here's a sample calculation:

|                  | Amount                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Gross income     | RON 35,000                           |
| Income tax (10%) | RON 3,500 = 10% \* RON 35,000        |
| Base for socials | RON 27,600/y = RON 2,300.00/mo \* 12 |
| Social sec (25%) | RON 6,900 = 25% \* RON 27,600        |
| Health ins (10%) | RON 2,760 = 10% \* RON 27,600        |
| Total tax        | RON 13,160 = 3,500 + 6,900 + 2,760   |

If you earn EUR 80k / year, your effective tax is RON 13,160 / RON 393,862 = **3.34%**. The higher your income, the lower the tax rate. Meanwhile, your tax base (i.e. income norm) remains the same.
