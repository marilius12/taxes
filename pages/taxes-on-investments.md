# Taxes on investments

Most countries have separate tax rates for investment income. Some (esp. low-tax countries like Romania) have a flat rate, others distinguish short-term and long-term gains (ex: US, Georgia). In some countries, only a portion of the investment income is taxed (ex: 50% in Canada) and certain deductions and/or tax credits apply. Yet in others, investment income is generally taxed as ordinary income (ex: Estonia). Sometimes, investment income is also subject to socials (ex: Hungary, Romania).

The tax treatment will usually depend on:

1. type of investment income
2. type of account you hold your investment in

## Types of investment income

- **Capital gains**: gain/loss from the disposal (sale) of assets (stocks, ETFs, real estate, etc.)
- **Dividends**: cash distributions from corporations you owe shares in
- **Interest**: cash distributions from interest-bearing assets (savings and money market accounts, bonds, CDs, etc.)

> NOTE: there are taxable benefits like health/life insurance, private pension, and annuity where funds are also invested.

In general, _capital gains_ are taxed the least:

- you are not liable for the tax until you **realize** the gain (i.e. sell)
  - exception: **wealth tax** on your net worth (ex: Italy, Spain, Colombia)
  - risk: proposal to tax unrealized gains (ex: in the US)
- you may **defer** the tax if you reinvest the gains (ex: 1031 exchange in the US)
- you may not pay the tax if you pass away
  - your beneficiary(ies) will pay **estate/inheritance/gift tax**
  - rarely, no tax at all (ex: stepped-up basis in US)
- you may offset gains with losses (**tax-loss harvesting**)
  - in general, you can time the sale to minimize the tax (ex: when retired)
- certain asset classes may be taxed more favorably than others
  - real estate
    - you can claim depreciation, deduct legal fees, commissions, etc.
    - gains may be exempt from tax up to a certain amount (ex: primary residence deduction)
    - tax rates may be lower if you own the property for multiple years
      - may vary between local and foreign real estate
  - stocks/ETFs
    - you may deduct transaction, accounting, and advisor fees
    - you may qualify for an exemption (ex: QSBS in US)

_Dividends_ are usually taxed higher than capital gains:

- some countries distinguish **qualified/eligible** and **non-qualified/non-eligible** divs
  - depending on where corp is based, private vs. public corp, % of shares and # of years you hold, etc.
- dividends from certain sources may be taxed at a higher rate
  - ex: distributions from REITs, MLPs, etc.
- foreign dividends can be taxed differently
  - you may be subject to **WTH tax** at the source
  - you may claim a **foreign tax credit** to offset double taxation
  - you may be unable to claim dividend tax credits (ex: Canada)
  - [dividends from ADRs](https://www.dividend.com/portfolio-management-channel/how-does-taxation-of-adr-stocks-affect-investors/) are subject to regular WTH tax (unless proper paperwork is filed)

_Interest_ income is usually the least tax-efficient:

- interest is often taxed as earned income
  - exception: certain bonds (ex: municipal in the US) may be exempt from federal and/or state tax

## Types of investment accounts

- **Margin/cash account**
- **Registered account**
  - retirement account (ex: IRA, RRSP, etc.)
  - education account (ex: 529 Plan, RESP, etc.)
  - health account (ex: HSA)
- **Trust**

_Margin_ account is a standard taxable account. It's best suited for:

- foreign dividends
  - you can usually opt for a reduced WTH tax based on DTT
  - you can also claim foreign tax credit(s) to offset WTH tax
  - otherwise, under a territorial tax regime, you pay no tax domestically
    - however, if there's no DTT, you'll pay regular WTH tax (ex: 30% in US)
    - you can also buy from another stock exchange (in UK, Germany, etc.) to pay lower WTH tax
- risky or speculative investments
  - ex: penny stocks, SPACs, IPOs, stock options
  - you can offset capital gains with losses
  - rarely, you can offset ordinary income (ex: up to USD 3k in US)
- angel investing
  - capital gains may be tax-exempt if you sell shares of a small business (start-up)
  - ex: up to USD $10M in QSBS (US), up to CAD 500k in LCGE (Canada)

_Registered_ accounts are specialized tax-advantaged accounts. They work best for:

- dividends and interest
  - income may be exempt from tax (ex: Roth IRA, TFSA)
    - optimal for non-qualified domestic dividends (ex: REITs)
  - otherwise, tax may be deferred until you make withdrawals (ex: 401k, RRSP)
  - however, WTH tax on foreign dividends is **not** recoverable
    - with some exceptions provided in DTTs (ex: US dividends exempt from WTH tax in Canadian RRSP)
- growth stocks
  - capital gains are also tax free (or deferred until you withdraw)
- low-risk investments
  - contribution room is limited and non-recoverable if you sell for a loss
  - safe investments lower the risk of losing your principal (for a degree, retirement, etc.)
    - i.e. core portfolio with low volalility, limited downside risk, and steady growth
    - ex: broad-market index funds (ETFs), blue-chip stocks, value stocks
