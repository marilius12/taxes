# Taxes for retirees

Most sources of retirement income are passive:

- Pension
- Rental
- Dividends
- Interest
- Royalties

## Withholding tax

When you earn foreign-source income, a **non-resident withholding tax** will typically be deducted before the payment is received. For example, when you, as a foreign person, receive a dividend from a US corporation, a 30% tax will be automatically withheld at the source. This rate can be reduced if the country you are a tax resident of has a tax treaty with the US (ex: 15% for Canadian residents, see [WTH taxes in US](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/united-states/corporate/withholding-taxes)).

Unfortunately, the WTH tax is **[non-refundable](https://ibkr.info/node/946)**. However, you may be able to claim a **foreign tax credit** to offset double taxation when you file your domestic tax return. Also, if the tax was withheld by mistake (ex: by a US client even though your service/product was _not_ US-sourced) or at an incorrect rate (ex: a general rate was applied instead of a reduced rate based on a tax treaty), you could file a foreign tax return to claim a refund (ex: Form 1040-NR in US).

The WTH tax is deducted from foreign-source payments such as dividends, interest, and royalties. Rental income (along with REITs) is often subject to the standard WTH tax that can't be reduced by a tax treaty (ex: 30% in US). Capital gains and directors fees may also be subject to WTH tax.

The rate of withholding also depends on the type of investment account (margin, registered, etc.) (see [taxes on investments](./taxes-on-investments.md)). Unfortunately, there may be multiple levels of WTH taxes (ex: divs from a US-listed ETF that holds international stocks). Level 1 WTH tax is levied by the foreign country where the corporation is domiciled and is often non-recoverable, while Level 2 WTH tax is levied by the country where the security is listed. For a US/Canada perspective, see [this white paper](https://www.pwlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2016-06-17_-Bender-Bortolotti_Foreign_Withholding_Taxes_Hyperlinked.pdf).

## Workarounds for WTH taxes

1\. Invest in contries with a **zero** or **low** non-resident WTH tax

- some countries don't levy a WTH tax on dividends, ex: UK (LON), HK (HKG)
- other countries have a low WTH tax, ex: 10% in China (SHG)
- NOTE foreign divs from interlisted stocks are still subject to WTH tax
  - ex: US company is listed on both NYSE (USD) and TSX (CAD)
  - Canadian residents will still pay 15% WTH tax even if they buy on TSX
  - WTH tax is deducted based on the origin of the distributions (i.e. US)
  - which stock exchange the shares are traded on and in which currency is irrelevant
- NOTE companies in EM countries (ex: Russia) have low P/Es and high div yield

2\. Move to a country with a **lower** WTH rate based on a **tax treaty**

- some countries that signed DTTs have a lower WTH tax
- ex: US WTH tax is generally 30%, but is 10% for tax residents of Bulgaria, Romania, etc.
- ex: Japan has a 20% WTH tax that can be reduced to 10-15%

3\. Invest in **domestic companies**

- divs from local companies are often subject to lower tax rates and/or tax credits
  - ex: qualified divs in US, eligible divs in Canada, etc.
- in lower tax brackets, you may be exempt from tax and/or have a negative tax to offset other income
  - NOTE div income above a certain threshold may affect your pension (ex: OAS clawback in Canada)

4\. Earn **capital gains**

- WTH tax is usually _not_ applied to capital gains
- instead of dividends or interest, earn from capital appreciation
  - ex: invest in growth stocks (ex: US tech), sell shares when retiring
  - ex: sell call options for a premium, trade futures, etc.
