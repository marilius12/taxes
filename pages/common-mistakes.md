# Common mistakes

> If I open a bank account in a tax haven country, I don't have to pay taxes on the interest.

Most countries tax your **worldwide income** meaning that regardless of where your income originates, it's still subject to domestic taxes. If you fail to report this income (or disclose your foreign holdings, ex: FBAR in the US) on your tax return, you may face penalties. There are some exceptions - for example, under territorial tax, your foreign passive income is exempt, and under remittance-based tax, you don't pay the tax if you don't (or until you do) remit foreign income into your country.

> If I open a company in a tax haven country, I don't have to pay any corporate tax.

In almost any country, your company is a tax resident if it has its **management and control** there. It usually doesn't matter where the business is registered, and those countries that only consider the place of registration (ex: Bulgaria, Thailand, Georgia, etc.) also apply **CFC** and/or **source income** rules. For example, if you a. manage your business, or b. are a tax resident of, or c. have source income in your home country, your company is also a tax resident in that country.

> If I live in a territorial-tax country and only work for foreign clients, I don't have to pay any income tax.

Territorial-tax countries like Panama and Georgia still tax your **local-sourced income**. It doesn't matter where the clients are. If you live and work in a country, then your income is sourced locally and is thus subject to the local income tax. For individuals, the territorial tax exemption mostly applies to passive income from abroad - it does not apply to active earned income. Failure to disclose this income would constitute tax fraud.

> Once I become a tax resident in a tax haven country, I can live and work anywhere tax-free.

Some countries like Cyprus offer tax residency if you spend a few weeks or months there. Unfortunately, being a tax resident in one of these countries, even having a tax ID or tax certificate, does not prevent you from _also_ becoming a tax resident in another country. Unless you are exempt under a double-tax treaty, doing work or running a business abroad can make you liable for income tax in that other country (based on CFC or source income rules).

> If I stay less than 183 days in a country, I don't have to pay any tax.

Depending on the country, it's possible to spend less than 183 days and still become a tax resident, or spend more than 183 days and not trigger tax residency. That's because most countries consider not only the time you are present there, but also your **residential ties** such as your primary home, spose/common-law partner and/or dependents, as well as your **center of vital interests** and **habitual abode**. For instance, if your primary home is in Australia but you spend most of the year traveling abroad, you would still be deemed an Australian tax resident, even if you spend less than 183 days there. As you'll see below, even if you're not a tax resident in a country, you may still owe taxes there.

> If I'm not a tax resident in a country, I can live and work there without paying any tax.

Most countries tax both residents and non-residents on income that is sourced locally. As such, you do **not** have to be a tax resident in a foreign country to owe taxes there. For instance, if you travel and work remotely in a foreign country as a non-resident, your work is technically local sourced and thus subject to the local income tax. Often though, the DTT with your home country will overwrite the local tax code, and you will only pay taxes to one of the two countries - the one in which you have your permanent home or other ties. However, if there isn't a DTT between them, you may owe taxes to both.

> If I live 4 months in 3 different countries, I don't have to pay taxes anywhere.

As mentioned above, spending less than 183 days in a country does not exempt you from their taxes. If you work in a country, even remotely for a foreign employer or client, your income is locally sourced and thus taxable. In addition, forming ties with the said country may create tax liability. Similarly, conducting business there may constitute permanent establishment.

In practice, if you have a base and the countries you travel to have DTTs, you will pay personal income tax to your base. As such, your tax residency is in the country you have your permanent home, center of vital interests, habitual abode (home you return to), or citizenship. Again, if there isn't a DTT with your home country, of if your business has permanent establishment in said foreign country, you may owe taxes to both.

> If I live in a territorial-tax country, I can earn passive income from abroad tax-free.

When you earn income that is sourced in a foreign country, a **non-resident withholding tax** is usually deducted before the payment is even received. For example, if a US company pays you, a foreign person, a dividend, it will withhold 30% from the distribution (thus diminishing your dividend yield). Although this tax is non-refundable, it's usually reduced by a tax treaty with your home country (ex: from 30% to 15%). If your country then taxes those dividends again as worldwide income, you can offset double taxation by claiming foreign tax credits on your tax return.

> Once I am no longer a tax resident of my home country, I don't have to pay taxes there.

Your home country will still levy non-resident withholding taxes on any income sourced locally. For example, as a tax non-resident, if you keep a rental property when you leave Canada, your rental income will be subject to the 25% withholding tax. This tax also applies to any other local-sourced income like interest or dividends (although the rate on those may be reduced with a tax treaty). You may also need to file a non-resident income tax return to report this income.

> If I invest in stocks through my offshore company, I can pay a lower withholding tax on dividends.

Most countries have **anti-treaty shopping** provisions, in particular, **limitation on benefits clauses**. If you want to benefit from a reduced WTH tax rate in a foreign country, you will need to establish economic substance there.
