# Common mistakes

> If I open a bank account in a tax haven country, I don't have to pay any tax on interest.

Most countries tax your **worldwide income** meaning that regardless of where your income originates, it's still subject to domestic taxes. If you fail to disclose your foreign holdings, you may have to pay a penalty (ex: FBAR in the US). There are some exceptions - for example, under a territorial tax, your foreign passive income is exempt, and under remittance-based tax, you don't pay the tax if you don't (or until you do) remit foreign income into your country.

> If I open a company in a tax haven country, I don't have to pay any corporate tax.

In almost any country, your company is a tax resident if it has its **mind, management and control** there. If you are the sole shareholder, and you live and conduct business in your home country, your company is also a tax resident in that country. It usually doesn't matter where the business is registered, and those countries that only consider the place of registration (ex: Bulgaria) also tend to have CFC and other anti-avoidance rules.

> If I live in a territorial-tax country and work for foreign clients, I don't have to pay any income tax.

Territorial-tax countries like Panama and Georgia still tax your **local-sourced income**. It doesn't matter where the clients are. If you live and work in a country, then your income is sourced locally and is thus subject to the local income tax. For individuals, the territorial tax exemption mostly applies to passive income from abroad - it does not apply to active earned income. Failure to disclose this income would constitute tax fraud.

> If I stay less than 183 days in a country, I don't have to pay any tax.

Most countries consider not only the time you spend there, but also the ties you have with that country. In most cases, if your **center of vital interests** is in your home country, then you are deemed its tax resident, even if you spend less than 183 days there.

For example, if you travel abroad throughout the year but your family, primary residence, or other residential ties are in your home country, you are still subject to its taxes. There are some nuances - for example, in Georgia, you automatically become a tax resident after 183 days, so you may end up being a tax resident of two countries, and if there isn't a DTT, you may have to pay (some) taxes to both.

> If I live 4 months in 3 different countries, I don't have to pay taxes anywhere.

In theory, it's possible to not be a tax resident of any country. In practice, you are most certainly a tax resident somewhere depending on the laws of the countries you visit and the country you are domiciled in. Typically, your tax residency is in the country you spend the most time in and/or have the most ties with (family, property, bank accounts, etc.). Otherwise, you might default to being a tax resident of your country of citizenship.

> Once I am no longer a tax resident of my home country, I don't have to pay taxes there.

Most countries will still tax your local-sourced income. For example, as a tax non-resident, if you keep a rental property in your home country, your rental income will be subject to **withholding tax**. The same applies to other income sourced locally like interest or dividends. You may also need to file a non-resident income tax return to report this income.

> If I invest in stocks through my offshore company, I can pay a lower withholding tax on dividends.

Most countries have **anti-treaty shopping** provisions, in particular, **limitation on benefits clauses**. If you want to benefit from a reduced WTH tax rate in a foreign country, you will need to establish economic substance there.
