# Common mistakes

> If I open a bank account in a tax haven country, I don't have to pay any tax on interest.

Most countries tax your **worldwide income** meaning that regardless of where your income is sourced, it's still subject to tax. If you fail to disclose your foreign holdings, you may pay a hefty penalty (ex: FBAR in the US). There are some exceptions - for example, under a territorial tax, your foreign passive income is exempt, and under remittance-based tax, you don't pay the tax if you don't (or until you do) remit foreign income into your country.

> If I open a company in a tax haven country, I don't have to pay any corporate tax.

In almost any country, your company is a tax resident if it has its **mind, management and control** there. If you are the sole shareholder, and you live and conduct business in your home country, your company is also a tax resident in that country. It usually doesn't matter where the business is registered, and those countries that only consider the place of registration (ex: Bulgaria) also tend to have CFC and other anti-avoidance rules.

> If I live in a territorial-tax country and only work with foreign clients, I don't have to pay income tax.

Territorial-tax countries like Panama and Georgia still tax your **local-sourced income**. It doesn't matter where the clients are. If you live and work in a country, then your income is sourced locally and is thus subject to the local income tax. For individuals, the territorial tax exemption mostly applies to passive income from abroad - it does not apply to active earned income. Failure to disclose this income would be tax fraud.

> If I stay less than 183 days in a country, I don't have to pay any tax.

Most countries consider not only the time you spend there, but also the ties you have with the country. If your **center of vital interests** or **habitual/permanent abode** is in your home country, then you are a tax resident there. In most cases, you don't necessarily need to spend any time in a country to be its tax resident.

For example, if you travel abroad throughout the year but your family, primary residence, or other residential ties are in your home country, you are still subject to its taxes. There are some nuances - for example, in Georgia, you automatically become a tax resident after 183 days, so you may end up a tax resident of two countries, and if there isn't a DTT, you may have to pay (some) taxes to both.

> If I live 4 months in 3 different countries, I don't have to pay taxes anywhere.

In theory, it's possible to not be a tax resident of any country. In practice, it might be difficult to bank without a tax residency somewhere. In addition, to become a tax non-resident, you first need to sever ties with your home country - this typically involves establishing ties elsewhere. In some countries (ex: Canada), you must establish tax residency in another country, otherwise you default to being a tax resident in your home country, even if you no longer live there.

> Once I am no longer a tax resident of my home country, I don't have to pay taxes there.

Most countries will still tax your local-sourced income. For example, if you keep a rental property in your home country and you stop being a tax non-resident there, your rental income will now be subject to **withholding tax**. The same applies to other income sourced locally like interest or dividends. You may also need to file a non-resident income tax return to report this income.

> If I invest in stocks through my foreign company, I can pay a lower withholding tax on dividends.

Most countries have **anti-treaty shopping** provisions, in particular, **limitation on benefits clauses**. If you want to benefit from a reduced WTH tax rate in a foreign country, you will need to establish enonomic substance there.
