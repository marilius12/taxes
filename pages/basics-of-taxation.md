# Basics of Taxation

## Disclaimer

None of this is legal or tax advice, seriously. If you move from one state to another, or from one English-speaking country to another, and your situation is relatively simple (ex: regular employee), then you can get away with doing taxes on your own. You can read official guides on the revenu service website, use free tax software, or ask for advice on Reddit.

However, when you move to a foreign country with a foreign language, you should absolutely work with a professional - at the very least, a local English-speaking CPA, ideally an international tax CPA, or even a lawyer if your taxes are complex. Don't take this content as a substitute. This is just to guide you if you're getting started. Do your own due diligence and respect the law.

## Types of Taxes

### Based on the origin

- **Territorial tax**
  - only local-sourced income is taxed (ex: employment, corporate, rental income, etc. earned locally)
    - NOTE: if you live and work in a country, your labor is considered local-sourced regardless of where your clients are located
  - foreign-sourced income is exempt (ex: dividends, interest, rental income, etc. from abroad)
  - ex: Panama, Costa Rica, Georgia, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, etc.
- **Residence-based tax**
  - worldwide income from all sources, local and foreign, is taxed if individual (or corporation) is as a **tax resident** of the country
    - NOTE: if you live in a western country and open an offshore bank account in a tax haven like Cayman Islands, the interest you earn will still be taxable in your home country; if you fail to report this income, you are likely committing tax fraud and may face penalties (ex: FBAR)
  - ex: most of the world including Americas, Europe, Asia, etc. with a few exceptions
- **Citizenship-based tax**
  - certain income is taxed even if you are not a tax resident in the country and/or are a tax resident elsewhere
  - ex: US, Myanmar, Hungary, Eritrea
- **Remittance-based tax**
  - certain income is not taxed until remitted in the country (or not taxed at all if remitted after X year/s)
  - ex: Gibraltar, Singapore, Malta, UK, Thailand, Georgia
- **Non-domiciled tax**
  - special tax regime for non-domiciled residents (usually to defer taxes)
  - ex: Cyprus, Malta, UK, Ireland, etc.

### Based on the tax rate

- **Flat tax**
  - fixed-rate tax that doesn't vary based on income
  - ex: Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, etc.
- **Progressive tax**
  - variable tax based on tax brackets, imposes higher burden on higher-income earners
  - ex: US, Canada, Astralia, UK, France, Germany, Sweden, etc.

### Based on the tax burden

- **Zero tax**
  - no tax or 0% tax is levied
  - ex: UAE, Qatar, BVI, Cayman Islands, Vanuatu, Monaco, Bermuda, etc.
- **Low tax**
  - relatively low (single-digit or low teens) tax is levied
  - ex: Romania, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Moldova, Georgia, Hungary, etc.
- **Lump-sum tax**
  - fixed sum (ex: EUR 100k) is paid annualy on certain/most income; works best for HNWI
  - ex: Italy, Greece, Switzerland, etc.
- **Tax holidays/exemptions**
  - special tax programs often for 3/5/10 years to attract workers, entrepreneurs, investors, etc.
  - ex: Uruguay, Peru, Portugal, etc.

### Based on the type of income

- **Income tax**
  - **Personal income tax (PIT)**: paid by individuals on employment and other income (dividends, interest, etc.)
  - **Corporate income tax (CIT)**: paid by corporations on profit (i.e. revenue after expenses, salaries, debts, etc. but before dividends)
- **Capital gains tax (CGT)**: paid on the sale of assets (investments, property, currencies, crypto, metals, etc.)
- **Dividend tax**: paid by individuals that received dividends from a corp (or withheld by corp when distributing dividends)
- **Interest tax**: paid on interest accrued in bank accounts, bonds, CDs, etc.
- **Payroll (social security) tax**: paid by both employees and employers, as well as self-employed to fund pensions, healthcare, employment insurance, parental leave, etc.
- **Sales tax/GST/VAT**: paid by consumers when buying products and services
- **Property tax**: paid by real estate owners
- **Import tax/duty/tariff**: paid on goods and resources imported from other countries
- **Stamp duty**: paid on documents, licenses, cards, checks, receipts, etc.

  - **Sin tax**: paid on products deemed harmful (ex: tobacco, alcohol, fast food, soft drinks, etc.)
- **Energy tax**: paid by consumers and/or producers of fuels, oil, gas, etc.
  - **Carbon tax**: paid by producers of carbon-based fuels (coal, oil, gas)
- **Estate/death tax**: paid on the transfer of assets (investments, property, etc.) of a deceased person based on their FMV (either by will or intestacy)
  - **Inheritance tax**: paid by beneficiaries (recipients, heirs) of the estate of a deceased person

- **Solidarity tax**: paid by higher-income earners to support low and middle-income households
- **User fees**: paid for admission to parks, museums, also toll fees for roads and bridges

### Based on geography

- **federal**: levied by the federal government
- **state/provincial**: levied by the state (ex: US), province (ex: Canada), region (ex: Italy), etc.
- **municipal/local**: levied by the county (ex: US), city (ex: LA), district, etc.

## Types of Income

- **Gross income**: total income from all sources before any expenses, deductions, or taxes
- **Net income**: income after all expenses, deductions, and taxes

For corporations, gross income is also the **top line** (on the income statement), while net income is the **bottom line**.

Companies also distinguish revenue and profit which are slightly different:

- **Revenue**: gross sales of goods/products
- **Profit**: net sales i.e. gross sales minus all expenses, debts, costs, etc.

## Tax Base

**Tax base (taxation basis)** is the portion of income that is subject to tax (also, **taxable income**).

_Individuals_ pay taxes (PIT and socials) on their gross income minus deductions (ex: personal allowance, pension fund contributions, etc.). Socials use your gross income as the tax base, but are sometimes capped (ex: 12 \* min or avg monthly wage).

_Corporations_ pay taxes (CIT) on their profits. Profits are then distributed to shareholders as dividends (which are then taxed _again_ at the personal level).

## Business Structure

Most freelancers and digital nomads will fall into one of the following:

- natural person
  - **employee**: paid a **salary** by an employer (usually, foreign), subject to **PIT** and **socials**
  - **independent contractor**: registered as a **sole proprietor**, bills clients with **invoices**, also subject to **PIT** and **socials** (both **employee** + **employer** portion)
- legal entity
  - **corporation**: incorporated business, usually an LLC, pays **CIT** and socials on **salary**, distributes dividends
    - individual also pays **div tax** (sometimes, withheld by corp) and/or **PIT + socials** on salary

_Employees_ are usually taxed at the higher rates because of progressive PIT and mandatory socials. They have some personal allowances and home-office deductions, but those are limited. However, employees enjoy labor rights, health insurance, EI/severance pay, PTO, etc.

_Self-employed_ can pay less PIT by deducting **business expenses** from gross income, but they also pay higher socials (both employee and employer side). Contractors don't get any benefits or PTO, and they often need to purchase private health and contractors insurance.

Despite tax integration, _corporations_ are often the most tax-efficient because they can pay a reduced **small business** CIT rate at the corporate level, and a flat **dividend tax** at the personal level (typically, lower than PIT). As a director/manager, you can decide how much to pay yourself in salary and thus in PIT and socials.

## Residency vs. Tax residency

These terms are commonly confused. Note that they can all be in different countries simultaneously!

- **Residency**
  - legal status (privilege) to stay in another country as a foreign citizen
  - **temporary residency (TR)**: 1-5 years, foreign students, workers, business partners, etc., may lead to PR
  - **permanent residency (PR)**: renewed every 5-10 years, entitled to most rights except voting, may lead to citizenship
  - NOTE: legal and tax residency may differ; for example, banks may only ask to declare legal residency and address; sometimes, they may not care about your tax residency (although they do when withholding tax)
  - NOTE: residenc**y** is a legal condition or fact of living in a country, whereas a residenc**e** is the place where you live like your home or street address.
- **Tax residency**
  - being subject to the tax laws of a country (i.e. where you pay taxed)
  - usually, you are a tax resident of **one** country
  - unfortunately, could be a tax resident of **two or more** countries
    - DTTs may or may not be in place to offset double taxation
  - in theory, could be a tax resident of **no** country (although this complicates banking)
- **E-residency**
  - neither legal nor tax residency; just an online registration for government services
- **Domicile**
  - either where you are a citizen of _or_ where you have been a tax resident of in the last X years
  - you may be treated differently as a non-domiciled tax resident vs. domiciled tax resident
  - varies by country: Cyprus, UK, Ireland, Malta, Italy, Greece
- **Citizenship**
  - status of being a citizen of a country (by land, blood, naturalization, descent, etc.)
    - example map of countries by birthright citizenship on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/nn7evq/places_where_birthright_citizenship_is_based_on/)
  - stateless person: someone not considered a national by any state

## Tax residency rules

Each jurisdiction has its own rules for determining tax residency. Some countries apply residency tests (ex: SRT in the UK, substantial presence test in the US, etc.).

Tax residency is a question of **fact**. Usually, tax authorities publish guidelines on tax residency that you can read online. The fine print can be found in the applicalbe tax act(s) as well as case law. Finally, any DTTs that are in place will overwrite local laws.

### Individual residency

An individual is taxed based on where they are a tax resident. The following factors are commonly taken into account:

- **183 day rule**
  - automatically a tax resident if you spend more than 183 days in any 12-month period
- **center of vital interests**
  - based on residential ties (business, economic, social, etc.)
    - ex: primary residence, property, job/business, bank accounts, documents/IDs, memberships
  - may trump the 183-day rule depending on the DTT
- habitual (or permanent) **abode**, principal place of **sojourn**, etc. of person and/or their **spouse and dependents**
- nationality/**citizenship** (ex: US)

For most people leaving western countries, the best course of action is to make a **clean break** i.e. sever all ties with your home country (sell your home, car, close bank accounts, etc.), and permanently move yourself, your family, and your business to the new country. Alternatively, you could sever all **significant ties** (like your primary residence) but keep some **secondary ties** (like your driver's license or private pension fund).

In some countries, to become a **tax non-resident**, you must establish tax residency elsewhere. If you don't, they may still consider you a tax resident there (ex: factual resident in Canada). As such, you may have to acquire a tax ID number or a tax certificate in the country you are moving to.

As a non-resident of your home country, if you receive local sourced income, you may still have to file a **tax return**. However, if a DTT is in place, that income is usually tax exempt, because the other country already taxes your wordwide income. Some notable exemptions are the US (see foreign earned income exclusion).

### Corporate residency

A company is taxed based on where it is a tax resident. Tax authorities consider the place of:

- **registration** (i.e. incorporation), _and/or_
- **management and control**
  - place of effective management (POEM) i.e. strategic decisions are made in the country
  - X% of executives/members on the board of directors are resident in the country
  - economic substance (headquarters, operations, employees, etc.) is in the country

In most cases, the company is taxed **where it is managed and controlled** regardless of where it's registered. Ex: if you form an offshore company in Belize but continue to live and work from Canada, your company is still a tax resident of Canada and is be subject to Canadian taxes.

Most countries apply both registration and management & control. Some only apply one or the other, but may still have CFC and/or hybrid mismatch rules to counteract tax avoidance.

### Double Taxation

Unfortunately, you could be a tax resident of **multiple countries**. If there is a **double taxation treaty (DTT)** between countries, you may qualify for treaty relief. In this case, DTT will overwrite local tax laws. Which country ends up charging you the tax is determined by the **tie breaker rules** in the DTT where your permanent home and center of vital interests will factor in.

If there is no DTT in place (often the case for blacklisted or tax haven countries), then you might be subject to double taxation. However, the other country would usually have no tax, very low tax, or territorial tax (where foreign-sourced income is exempt from taxes).

## Corporate residency

Several important concepts and/or rules apply in determining the tax residency of a company.

### Permanent Establishment (PE)

TODO

### Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC)

### Mind and Management

### Hybrid Mismatch

## Tax Avodance vs. Tax Evasion

- **Tax optimization**
  - **legally** and ethically structuring your affairs in a way to owe less in taxes
  - tax planning, where arrangements are consistent with the intent of the law
  - ex: incrorporation if you're self-employed, contributing to retirement funds (for deductions), relocating to another jurisdiction, taking advantage of tax incentives or programs, etc.
- **Tax avoidance**
  - also **legal** but often unethical, using agreesive or abusive tax planning that pushes the limits of the laws
  - ex: complex international tax planning (escpecially, by multinationals), using tax loopholes, hybrid mismatch, holding or flow-through companies, etc.
  - often met with countermeasures, ex: laws/ammendments, anti-avoidance rules, blacklisting, CRS, OECD, etc.
- **Tax evasion**
  - **illegal**, not paying taxes owed, under-reporting income, ignoring laws, has criminal consequences
  - ex: claiming non-deductible expenses, providing false information, money laundering, etc.
