# Tax optimization strategies

There are 3 general ways to reduce taxes:

1. lower your tax rate
2. lower your taxable income
3. defer taxes

To _reduce your tax rate_, you can:

- earn other types of income
  - **employment income**: salary/wages (most people), often progressive tax
  - **business income**: self-employed or incorporated
  - **royalty income**: from IP
  - **rental income**: lease a property
  - **investment income**: capital gains, divs, int
    - usually taxed **lower** than active income ([see more](./taxes-on-investments.md))
    - you don't pay tax **until you sell** (potentially, indefinitely)
    - can sell for a loss to offset gains (**tax-loss harvesting**)
    - also: **margin loan** with investments as collateral
    - downside: WTH tax, wealth tax, proposed tax on unrealized gains (US)
- relocate to a jurisdiction with **lower tax rates** (flat or zero)
  - ex: UAE, Bulgaria, Cyprus, etc.

To _reduce your taxable income_ you can:

- use **deductions** and **tax credits** strategically
  - medical expenses, child credits, pension deductions, employer match, etc.
- become **self-employed** to write-off **business expenses**
  - ex: can deduct travel expenses, equipment, rent, etc.
  - limitations may apply (ex: meals only deductible 50% in US)
- **incorporate** your business
  - **small-business deduction**, credits, and incentives in some countries
  - distribute profits as **dividends**
    - typically, taxed lower than **PIT** and not subject **socials**
    - beware: tax integration, also minimum tax (ex: Canada)
  - control how much and when you pay salary/divs
    - can leave the rest in company or reinvest
  - **deductible benefits**: health, pension plan, education
  - income splitting with partners, family, etc.
  - downside: setup costs, recurring administrative costs and filing, etc.

In some countries, you can also _defer taxes_:

- retain earnings in the company
  - **Estonian tax model**: profits taxed at CIT upon **distribution** (i.e. div payout)
  - ex: Estonia, Georgia
- retain income in the country of origin
  - **remittance-based tax**: profits taxed when/if brought in the country
  - ex: UK and Malta (under resident **non-dom status**), also Thailand
