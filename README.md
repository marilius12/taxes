## Disclaimer

IANAL and IANACPA. None of this is legal or tax advice, seriously.

If you move from one state to another, or even from one English-speaking country to another, and your situation is relatively simple (ex: regular employee), then you could handle taxes on your own. For example, you can read the official guidelines from the revenu service website, use free tax software, or ask for general advice on online forums.

However, if you're moving to a foreign-speaking country, you should absolutely work with a professional - at the very least, a local CPA, ideally an international tax CPA, or even a lawyer if your situation is complex. Don't take this content as a substitute. In general, don't take advice from strangers on the internet. Do your own research and respect the law.
